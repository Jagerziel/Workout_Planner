# Technical Notes
The Workout Planner website was constructed using React and Vite.

### Consolidated placement of routes
All routes can be found in the App.js file

### Reusable Components
Components were structured to be reusable where possible.  

## Data
- Workout plan developed by Mr. Charlie
- Google image searches for exercise graphics

## Dependencies
- framer-motion
- redux
- react
- react-dom
- react-router-dom
- sass

# Future Features
- integrated backend with individual users
- user authentication
- ability to save personal workout plans (which is why redux was used/integrated before hand so the backbone of storing changes efficiently would already be in place)
- give user ability to add their own workouts with images and videos (would possibly require integration of image and video hosting site)
